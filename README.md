# What is Lithium?

Lithium is an attempt at several things at once:

 * An assembler for x86 CPUs, written in Clojure and using
   Clojure S-expressions as its input data. This part has been
   first announced in [this blog post][1].
 * A compiler for a toy Lisp-like language, using that assembler as a
   backend. The compiler is being written following the guidelines
   found in a paper "[An Incremental Approach to Compiler Construction][2]."

The purposes of Lithium are, first and foremost, to learn and to have fun.

# Try it out

In the REPL:

```clojure
(require '[lithium.compiler :as compiler])
(compiler/compile-and-run! "examples/stripes-grey.clj")
```
